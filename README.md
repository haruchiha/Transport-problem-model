The transportation optimization problem is a classic problem in the field of logistics management, playing a crucial role in optimizing the transportation of goods. The core objective is to find the optimal transportation solution for goods from known sources to specified destinations, ensuring the lowest transportation costs, highest transportation efficiency, and optimal resource utilization. At the same time, it meets constraints on the supply side such as the quantity of goods, supply capabilities, or demand for goods at each destination, as well as constraints related to vehicles. This report presents issues that can be modeled in an optimization problem and utilizes Googleâ€™s OR-Tools to solve this problem.
